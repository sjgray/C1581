These are reproductions of the C1581 Disk Drive PCB.
The goal of this is to create enhanced PCBs which
can be modified, ie: reduced area for mounting 
inside a computer.

Enhancements:
- Jumpers for 1581/Amiga or PC drive.
- Jumpers for drive select 0 or 1.
- SkinnyDIP RAM chip.
- Double-size ROM with select (Standard or JiffyDOW).
- Optional header for 12V+5V internal power.
- Optional Barrel Jack for 12V power.
- Long pads for easier soldering.

ENHANCED
--------

This is a version with the same layout as the original,
with all original features and ports, plus all
enhancements. It can be installed in an original or
reproduction case. It includes the breakaway LED board.
It can also be powered with a 12V supply by replacing
the original 4-PIN DIN with the barrel jack.

INTERNAL
--------

This is a compact version with a slightly arranged
layout to pack the chips closer together. It removes
the DIN connectors, and LED breakaway.

I will be testing the internal version first and will
release gerbers when it is verified working.
