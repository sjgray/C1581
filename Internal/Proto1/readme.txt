1581i - Internal Version - PROTO 1
========================

This is a reproduction of the C1581 Disk Drive PCB.
The goal of this is to create an enhanced PCB which
can be modified, ie: reduced area for mounting 
inside a computer.

Enhancements:
- Jumpers for 1581/Amiga or PC drive.
- Jumpers for drive select 0 or 1.
- SkinnyDIP RAM chip.
- Double-size ROM with select (Standard or JiffyDOW).
- Optional header for 12V+5V internal power.
- Optional Barrel Jack for 12V power.
- FPC connector for Laptop PC Drive.
- Long pads for easier soldering.
